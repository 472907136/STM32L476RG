# STM32L476RG
Librairy to manage ADXL345 accelerometer with a nucleo board
The purpose is from snippets of code in various existing libraries to make a library used with the STM32Lxx.
This library is to come with I2C first and SPI after.
The library contains functions to operate with tilt/inclination of the accelerometer
Others functions are used to manage accelerometer (calibration, offste, and so on)
